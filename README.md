In this project, I created a program called True Color that able to recognize the season of user personal color 
based on their skin tone that is taken from their face tone. This program uses computer vision to 
get the face tone in real time and the program will analyze and display the season of user that 
matches the most. The seasons are Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
